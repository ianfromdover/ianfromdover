# Heyo 👋
My name is Ian and I'm studying Computer Science at NUS. I hope to work in UX in the future, and I care most about making products learnable, useful and user-centric. When I'm not being a nerd, I enjoy playing piano, learning Japanese from VTubers and having deep conversations with my friends.

### I'm Currently
- Developing a VR or AR application with my team as part of [CS4240: Interaction Design for VR and AR](https://nusmods.com/modules/CS4240/interaction-design-for-virtual-and-augmented-reality)
- Getting fundamental knowledge of AI and ML with [CS2109S: Intro to AI and ML](https://nusmods.com/modules/CS2109S/introduction-to-ai-and-machine-learning)
- Creating my first CLI-based app with my team as part of [CS2130T: Software Engineering](https://nusmods.com/modules/CS2103T/software-engineering)
- Leading the publicity team and publicising [@nusjazzband](https://www.instagram.com/nusjazzband/)'s upcoming Annual Concert, **A Night To Remember**

### I Want To
- Redesign Plover's UX for a more intuitive and modern looking experience, while keeping the app lightweight
- Learn modelling in Blender and rendering in Unity or Unreal Engine to create amazing lighting for scenes 🏞
